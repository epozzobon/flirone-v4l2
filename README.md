### Flir One for Linux v4l2

This is a cleaned up version of code posted here:
http://www.eevblog.com/forum/thermal-imaging/question-about-flir-one-for-android/

All credit goes to tomas123, cynfab etc from that forum who did the awesome research and work to make this support.

(This fork is a quick hack to make it work with the 80x60 resolution version of the Flir ONE gen 3)
